# Events

-    Delegates provide the basic callback mechanism required for notifications 
-    Should the delegate be passed as a method argument, a constructor argument, or perhaps as a property? 
-    How should you support unsubscribing from notifications? 
-    From the outside, the only things you can do to an event are to attach a handler using `+=` and to remove one using `-=`
