# Microservices with .NET

(Martin Fowler and James Levis, “Microservices”, March 2014.)
> Microservices architectural style is an approach to developing a **single application as a suite of small services**, _each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms_, often an HTTP resource API. 
These services are _built around business capabilities_ and **independently deployable** by _fully automated deployment machinery_. 
There is a bare mininum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.
